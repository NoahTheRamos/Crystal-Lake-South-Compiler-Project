# Crytal Lake South High School - Interpreter

This is an intepreted language designed by students at a high school in a Chicago suburb known as Crystal Lake. There will be specific instructions on how you can contribute and have your code pushed to the main repository. 

This language is primarily designed for beginners to learn programming concepts easily in the more commmon ways they're represented. It also will soon be able to have functionality to be embeded in applications, so yeah..


This is a community project, everyone plays a part. The maintainer [Noah Ramos](https://www.github.com/NoahTheRamos) may answer any questions you have about the interpreter and how to contribute.
